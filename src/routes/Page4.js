/*
This one requires a bit more thinking to build than the other transitions above, 
the first obvious thing would be to create two <motion.div>â€™s. 

The outer one for Flip Animation and the inner <motion.div> would be responsible 
for the drop effect.
For the Flip Effect to take place, we use the ScaleX & ScaleY properties. 
ScaleX takes the element and Scales it down to the size specified. 
This distorts the element and mimics the look of a spinning element.

ScaleX can be used for flipping the page along the x-axis whereas used for
flipping the page along the y-axis.
The part for the drop-animations stays the same as before.
